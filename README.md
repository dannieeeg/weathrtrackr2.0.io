WEATHRTRACKR2.0 
 *Is another version of the weather tracker that I've previoulsy worked on with a different API worked into the program. This version used a much easier API Key to enter into the html and the javascript files that provides more information for the current day and future forecast.

The page is set up with a simple flex CSS style to have a clean and concise page set up.
