# weathrtrackr2.0.io
This is another weather tracking desktop website page. 

WEATHRTRACKR2.0 
This is another version of the weather tracker that I previously made with codepen and freecodecamp's guided projects. This version used a much easier API Key to enter into the html and the javascript files.

The page is set up with a simple flex CSS style to have a clean and concise page set up. 
languages used:
# html
# css
# javascript
# openweathermap
# API inclusion
